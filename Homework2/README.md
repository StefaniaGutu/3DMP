Homework 2

I downloaded a *pegboard pliers holder* ( https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4782051 ) from Thingiverse that I modified and turned it into a **pliers and screwdrivers holder**.
I added a support for five screwdrivers. I didn't make the holes symmetrical so that the screwdrivers could be taken more easily.

I designed model:
        - [x] A1
        - [x] A2
        - [x] A3
        - [x] A4
