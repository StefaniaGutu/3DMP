## Butterfly Automata Toy

For the final project I chose to make the ***Butterfly Automata Toy***. It is a mechanism that simulates the flight of the butterfly. I chose this mechanism because I was always fascinated by the graceful flight of butterflies.

The main components are:
- box
- axe
- butterfly
- disks
- handle
- connection rods

When the handle is rotated, the axe and the disks also begin to rotate. They move the butterfly through the connection rods that join them. The rotational motion is transformed into linear motion, and the butterfly gives the impression that it is flying.
