## Butterfly Automata Toy

For the final project I chose to make the ***Butterfly Automata Toy***. It is a mechanism that simulates the flight of the butterfly. I chose this mechanism because I was always fascinated by the graceful flight of butterflies.

The main components are:
- box
- axe
- butterfly
- disks
- handle
- connection rods

When the handle is rotated, the axe and the disks also begin to rotate. They move the butterfly through the connection rods that join them. The rotational motion is transformed into linear motion, and the butterfly gives the impression that it is flying.

Current progress:
- made the box, main axe, handle, disks, connection rods, butterfly
- I split the box into two components, so that I don't need additional material when printing it. I did the same for connection rods.
- For the axe, I added a washer and a lid.
- I split the butterfly into three components: body, right wing, left wing.
